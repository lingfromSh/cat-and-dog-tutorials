Use an alexnet to solve a bi-classification problem

## Training

You could run `train.py` to train the model.

After 100 epoches, this model could got more than 90% to give a correct classification. 

## Predicting

You could run `predict.py` and set the input image by flag `-f`. After a few seconds, the model will give you the answer.  

## Testing

You could run `test.py` to check whether this model is overfitting training resources.
